This is a Brawl Stars server recreated in 2d and 3d ui style, you can play it, create mods, and so on. This version is still raw, but it will be updated (the old v64 version with Gigi will be added later).


Currently, there are no files available, but they will be included once I finish a few features.

Mods can be created starting from the next version, v66.
